# Missing-Data-and-Noise-in-Comparison-of-Classification-Algorithms-on-UCI-Datasets
In this repository I compare some classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Decision Tree and AdaBoost on some datasets from UCI website. However, in this repository I have tried to experiment with noise, missing data and different approaches to handle them and see the comparison between them.
